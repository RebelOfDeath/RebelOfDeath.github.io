Roham Koohestani is a Software Engineer and AI4SE researcher based in The Hague, Netherlands. He studies Computer Science & Engineering at TU Delft and works at the intersection of large language models and developer tooling. Roham is driven by a core question: how can we build AI tools that truly support developers rather than distract them?

His work spans theory, experiment, and system-building; from modeling developer behavior and integrating AI into IDE workflows to empirically measuring trust, calibration, and usefulness in human–AI collaboration. He has collaborated across academia and industry (TU Delft, JetBrains Research, and others) to translate research insights into developer-facing tools and publications.

Looking ahead, Roham aims to pursue a PhD to advance the scientific foundations and real-world impact of AI-augmented software development while maintaining a strong engineering mindset.
