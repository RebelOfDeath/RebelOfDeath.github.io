        I specialize in Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE): applying ML and large language models to improve how software is written, reviewed, maintained, and evolved. My work spans theory, experiment, and system-building; including, but not limited to, modelling developer behaviors and integrating AI into IDE workflows to empirically measuring trust, calibration, and usefulness in human–AI collaboration.

        I collaborate across academia and industry (TU Delft, JetBrains Research, and others) to translate research insights into developer‑facing tools and publications. Looking ahead, I aim to pursue a PhD to advance calibrated, trustworthy, and impactful AI‑augmented software development. If you’re interested in collaborating on LLMs‑for‑Code, developer–AI interaction, or agentic systems, feel free to get in touch.
